### Amplifying Support through Web3-Powered Donation Matching
At Stream Tide, we understand that standing on the shoulders of giants is a part of innovation. We are deeply inspired by the pioneering work done by projects in the space of quadratic funding, which have established new paradigms for creator support and participation. These projects have not only innovated but have also laid a solid groundwork for others, like us, to build upon.

[CLRfund](https://github.com/clrfund), an open-source protocol for decentralized, permissionless, and extensible quadratic funding, has shown the power of individuals directly funding public goods and projects they care about, leveraging the collective strength of a crowd.

[Gitcoin Grants](https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack), an open-source initiative enabling community members to financially support projects they believe in, has demonstrated the potency of quadratic funding at its core, maximizing the impact of individual contributions in a transparent manner.

[BUDL Guidl](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/buidlguidl.com), an Ethereum ecosystem project by Austin Griffith, has brought to life the concept of decentralized developer collaboration, contributing to a shared codebase and benefiting from each other's work. 

We also draw inspiration from "[A Flexible Design for Funding Public Goods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421)" by Vitalik Buterin, Zoë Hitzig, and E. Glen Weyl, which extends ideas from Quadratic Voting to a funding mechanism for endogenous community formation. This work has set a theoretical foundation for the kind of public goods provision that Stream Tide aims to facilitate.

Stream Tide is proud to be part of this movement towards a more democratic and equitable future for creators and public goods. We are excited to continue learning from these and other projects in the quadratic funding space, and to contribute our own innovations to the ecosystem.
